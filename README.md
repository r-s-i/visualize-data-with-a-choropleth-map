# Education Degrees Granted in the United States

This is my answer to freeCodeCamp's Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map project. I have to assume it shows data that was gathered between 2010 and 2014. When the user hovers over one of the counties, its opacity will decrease and a tooltip with the county's name (and a percentage) will appear.

## Getting Started

Simply run the code by opening the index.html file in a web browser (using Live Server). [Or, more conveniently, go to where I host it](https://robiniversen.com/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map/).

## Data Source

The data is fetched from https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/for_user_education.json and https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/counties.json.
